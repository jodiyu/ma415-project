## Overview of the College Scorecard

The data is sourced from the U.S. Department of Education. It includes institution-level data files from the 1996-97 academic year through the 2022-23 academic year, containing aggregate information for each institution. 

*The dataset was last updated on October 10, 2024 and can be accessed using the following [link](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data).*

## Background and Purpose

The College Scorecard was created during the Obama Administration to provide transparent, accessible information to help students and families make informed decisions about higher education. It compiles data on metrics such as net price, graduation rates, student diversity, median graduate debt, salary data, and student loan repayment information.

The goal of this dataset was to create a federal tool that offers comprehensive institutional profiles, synthesizing complex and multi-dimensional aspects of higher education into understandable and standardized metrics.

## Initial Analysis on Flaws and Limitations

Although serving as a comprehensive and centralized federal postsecondary information system, the College Scorecard still contains flaws that undermine its overall effectiveness:

- **Lack of Qualitative Information:** The Scorecard focuses primarily on quantitative variables, particularly monetary measures of value. By reducing the measure of an institution’s worth to numerical factors, the Scorecard does not fully encapsulate an institution’s mission or character. This emphasis on financial metrics strips away the nuances of an institution and can lead to an inaccurate portrayal of the college experience.

- **Institutions Covered**: Postsecondary institutions sometimes comprise of separate campuses, including online programs and programs under different names. Each organization chooses which of its separate campuses to report data separately, which may cause complications in accurately comparing institutions with branch locations.

- **Cohort Definitions Vary for Different Metrics:** Measures of institutional performance are sometimesbased on different groups of students and are organized by different event dates. Users should exercise linking different data metrics with caution.

- **Earnings Data is Limited:** Earnings data are estimated for undergraduate Title IV recipients, due to its origination from the NSLDS earnings records. The share of each institution’s student body
of Title IV students varies substantially due to state and institutional aid policies. In institutions
where this share is low, results may be less representative of the entire student body. 


## Data Files and Variable Overview
Institution-level data files derived from the College Scorecard were the focal point of data analysis, including information on institutional characteristics, enrollment, costs, and student outcomes.

- **Institution Basics:** Institution, State, Status of Historically Black Institutions
- **Admissions and Testing:** Acceptance Rate, Average SAT Scores
- **Average cost and net price contingent on financial bracket:** Average Cost Of Attendance, Average Net Price Based on Income Level (Both Private and Public Universities)
- **Racial composition:** Percentage Undergraduate White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian
- **Financial aid and loan:** Percentage Receiving Loan from Federal Gov Each Year, Median Loan Debt for Students who Leave the University that Year
- **Completion rate:** Completion rate for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian Student Populations
- **Earnings after college:** Mean earnings from enrollment to 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Years After College

## Data Cleaning Process
#### College Scorecard
*Cleaned College Scorecard data can be found [here](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R).*
```{r eval=FALSE}
source("scripts/load_and_clean_data.R")
```

The original loaded education_cohort_data was *6484 rows x 3305 columns*. The cleaned dataset is *527 rows x 47 columns*. 

The **College Scorecard Data Dictionary** was used to parse through abbreviated terminology and retain all relevant data values. Columns were renamed to improve readability. Data entries missing key values, including acceptance rate, tuition, racial demographics, median loan amount, percentage receiving loan, median earnings after college, and completion rates, were removed. Data entries with the value "PS", for privacy suppressed data, were removed for consistency. 

All `med_loan_#` variables, initially in char format, were changed into numeric values. The `Avg_Mean_earning` variable was created and added as a separate column, calculated by averaging all average mean earnings from Years 6-10 for each corresponding row.  

*Technical documentation on the data can be found [here](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/assets/InstitutionDataDocumentation.pdf).*

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Condensed description of data cleaning process

# Loaded in the data
education_cohort_data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset-ignore","Most-Recent-Cohorts-Institution.csv"))

# Documented relevant data columns
table_cols <- c(
  # Institution and demographics on student population
  "INSTNM", "STABBR", ...
  
  # Repeated this process for all relevant categories
  
# Change data names
education_cohort_data <- education_cohort_data |>
  rename(
    Institution = INSTNM,
    State = STABBR, ...
    
    # Repeated this process for all relevant categories
    
# Removed rows that listed NA for key numerical values
education_cohort_data <- education_cohort_data |>
  filter_at(vars(one_of(cols_check_for_na)), all_vars(!is.na(.))) |>
  filter(if_all(all_of(Mean_earnings), ~ . != "PS"))

# Calculated the mean earning average for each university
education_cohort_data <- education_cohort_data |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(Avg_Mean_earning = mean(c_across(starts_with("Mean_earnings_After_")), na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ungroup()
```

#### NCES SAT Score Data
*NCES SAT Score Data can be found [here](/scripts/new_load_and_clean_data.R).*
```{r eval=FALSE}
source("scripts/new_load_and_clean.R")
```

Columns were renamed for readibility, and filtered down to include relevant SAT math and reading scores. The rows pertaining to income bracket were kept and renamed for readibility.


```{r eval=FALSE}
# Condensed description of data cleaning process

# Specifying columns to keep based on the indices, particularly columns related to SAT scores
table_col_indices <- c(1, 16, 17)

# Renaming the selected columns by their indices
colnames(SAT_data) <- c(
  "Income_Bracket",
  "Critical_Reading_Score",  # 16th column
  "Math_Score"               # 17th column
)

# Selecting rows 88 to 97 inclusive that pertain to student income brackets 
row_indices <- 88:97
SAT_data <- SAT_data[row_indices, ]

# Renaming rows based on their index positions (row indices)
row_names <- c(
  "Less_than_$20000",
  "$20000_to_$40000",
  ...
)
